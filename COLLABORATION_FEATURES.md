# Real-Time Collaboration Features

## Overview
This application now includes real-time collaboration features that allow multiple users to code together simultaneously, similar to Google Docs but for code.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Real-Time Collaboration
- **Live Code Editing**: Multiple users can edit the same code file simultaneously
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Changes are instantly synchronized across all participants
- **Cursor Tracking**: See where other users are typing in real-time
- **User Presence**: View who's currently active in the collaboration session

### ðŸ”— Easy Sharing
- **Shareable Links**: Generate unique room links to invite collaborators
- **Room Management**: Create, join, and manage collaboration rooms
- **Quick Access**: Copy room links with one click

### ðŸ’¾ Persistence & Export
- **Auto-Save**: Code changes are automatically saved to the room
- **Export to Snippets**: Save collaboration sessions as permanent code snippets
- **Room History**: Track when rooms were last active

### ðŸŽ¨ Multi-Language Support
- Support for all programming languages available in the editor
- Language-specific syntax highlighting and features
- Default code templates for each language

## How to Use

### Creating a Collaboration Room
1. Navigate to `/collaborate`
2. Click "Create Room"
3. Enter a room title and select programming language
4. Optionally add initial code
5. Click "Create Room" to start the session

### Joining a Room
1. Use a shared room link, or
2. Go to `/collaborate` and enter a room ID
3. You'll automatically join the active session

### Sharing a Room
1. In any active room, click the "Share" button
2. The room link is copied to your clipboard
3. Share the link with collaborators

### Saving Your Work
1. Click the "Save" button in the collaboration editor
2. Enter a title for your snippet
3. The current room code will be saved as a permanent snippet

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- **collaborationRooms**: Store room metadata and current code
- **roomParticipants**: Track active users in each room
- **codeChanges**: Log all code modifications for synchronization

### Real-Time Updates
- Uses Convex's real-time database features for instant synchronization
- Optimistic updates for smooth user experience
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

### Security
- Authentication required to create/join rooms
- Room access controlled by unique room IDs
- User identity tracked for all changes
